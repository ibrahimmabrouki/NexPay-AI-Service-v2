# the main function in this file is the retrieve_transactions function which takes a query and returns a list of transactions that are similar to the query based on the cosine similarity between the query embedding and the transaction embeddings stored in Qdrant.
# later on we will use this function in the RAG pipeline to retrieve the relevant transactions based on the user query and then use these transactions to generate a response to the user query.
